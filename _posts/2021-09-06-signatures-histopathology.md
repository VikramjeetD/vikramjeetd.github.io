title:  Deep Learning to Extract Signature and Subtype Information from Histopathology Images of Lung Cancer Patients
date:   2021-09-06 00:00:04
description: Mutational signatures and spectra contain extremely relevant clinician information to diagnose and monitor cancer. In collaboration with <u><a href="https://xulabs.github.io" target="_blank">XuLab</a></u> at CMU, I'm developing methods to extract these features as well as classify tissue subtypes to aid in suitable prognoses using deep learning.
